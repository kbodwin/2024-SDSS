## Building a sustainable open-source ecosystem {.theme-title2 .center}

### Lessons from an NSF POSE grant for the `data.table` package

#### Kelly Bodwin

#### California Polytechnic State University

## Background {.theme-section3 .center}

`data.table` is an R package for **dataset manipulation** and **summarizing**

It is...

. . .

widely used 😍

. . .

super super fast (like, *really* fast) 🌟

. . .

... and somewhat stagnant. 😢

. . .

So, **Toby Hocking (NAU)** submitted a grant proposal in 2023.

## NSF POSE {.theme-section2 .center}

> Supports the facilitation, creation and growth of open-source ecosystems for the creation of new technology solutions.

## A "sustainable ecosystem" is... {.theme-section1 .center}

. . .

### **...engaging**

&emsp; *Regular frequent interaction between different types of members*

### **...evolving**

&emsp; *Adapts and grows over time and in response to new environmental changes.*

### **...enduring**

&emsp; *Lasts over many years, or many lifecycles.*
